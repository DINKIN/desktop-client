    "description": "ROSALIND team has been working in the field of personal genetics and molecular biology since 2010. Starting with 2012, our team was developing our own system of personal genetic diagnostics, including new technological solutions for the individual analysis, and also brand new algorithms for the evaluation of the cumulative effects of genetic factors on the symptoms. In 2015, our development was supported by \"Program of translational research and innovation Skoltech\", established in the framework of the Center for entrepreneurship and innovation, SKOLKOVO Institute of science and technology. The main pride of the company, are its employees: experts in the field of medical genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Our research is published in leading international scientific journals: Genes Development, Nucleic Acid Research, BMC Genomics, Molecular Biology and Evolution, Biochemistry, Epigenetics and many other",

Similarly, new research has shown the importance of antioxidants in general health and specifically their critical role in the way the skin looks, feels and how fast it ages. A balanced diet in combination with appropriate antioxidants and vitamin supplementation can help maintain health and slow down the appearance of signs of aging.",
